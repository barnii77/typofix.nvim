# Overview
typofix is a tiny neovim plugin written in lua which lets you add and remove vim abbreviations on the fly and they will be managed for you by the plugin.
It also lets you turn the abbreviations created by itself on and off.
The idea of typofix is to build up a library of typos you tend to make over time and after having **effortlessly and quickly** created a new typo entry, it will be fixed for you on the fly from then on (if toggled on)
